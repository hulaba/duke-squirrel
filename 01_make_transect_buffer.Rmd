## Prepare transect buffers

```{r}
# load libs
library(sf)
```

```{r}
# find files
transects <- list.files("data/spatial/", pattern = "gpx", full.names = TRUE)
# read files as sf
transects <- lapply(transects, sf::st_read, layer = "tracks")

# get buffer sizes in metres
buffer <- rep(200, each = length(transects))

# convert to UTM17, buffer by 40 or 90m and reconvert
transect_buffers <- mapply(function(z, b) {
  z <- st_transform(z, 32617)
  z <- st_buffer(z, b)
  z <- st_transform(z, 4326)
  z$buffer_size <- b
  return(z)
}, transects, buffer, SIMPLIFY = F)

# reduce
tb <- Reduce(rbind, transect_buffers)
tb <- tb[, c("name", "buffer_size")]
```

## Export data

```{r}
# export as shp
st_write(tb, "data/spatial/transects_all.shp", delete_dsn = T)

# export bounds
tb_bbox <- st_sf(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(tb)))

# export as shp
st_write(tb_bbox, "data/spatial/transect_bbox.shp", delete_dsn = T)
```
